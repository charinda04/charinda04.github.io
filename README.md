Charinda's personal portfolio website built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

**Note:** The source for this site was created as my personal portfolio and learning project. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was written for my own use case preferences. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for cloning and deploying this exact setup. I recommend using the [Next.js Portfolio Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) or creating your own unique design from scratch.
